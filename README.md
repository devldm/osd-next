# lunit-osd-next

This project uses lunits OSD renderer within NextJS.

## Project goals

As this is largely based on the demo projects from the [lunit-osd-renderer](https://github.com/lunit-io/osd-react-renderer) project, it's mainly a exercise in reading, understanding and refactoring already written code in a new framework / environment. 
I also haven't worked on this style of project before (an openseadragon viewer) so i hope to learn more about styling and state management within this project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
